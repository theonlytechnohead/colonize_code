  dialogue:
  - 'The realization of a dream held in hope for a long time: for some, it is years,
    for others, several decades.'
  - But for most people, it has been a dream that would only be reckoned centuries
    in the future.
  - Now the dream is reality, and science fiction must expand its horizons ever further
    from our home, because now we have reached further than any imagined possible
    when the dream began.
  - We have reached outside of our own planet, and spread further than our solitary
    moon, to a completely different planet.
  - "A planet both hot and yet cold, a planet of war and yet peace, a planet that
    is said to be called\u2026"
  - the red planet.
